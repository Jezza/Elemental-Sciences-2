Credit for the power system goes to the CoFH team. Thanks a lot gents. :)
Thanks to all the people that could put up with my presence in #minecraftforge.

**Compiling the mod**  
Because this mod is really early stage, I can't blame you for wanting to compile this code, rather then the released versions. The released versions for now are behind because I want to establish a proper foothold in things. EG, code base, and build server up and running, etc.  
But note that I take no responsibility for the outcome of the compile, as noted in the license.  
If you need to ask how to compile it, because it's in the early stages I'd recommend not to.

**About the Mod**
***
Something that has always annoyed me, is that once you get to that late game area, there isn't a lot to do.  
I mean, sure, you have GregTech, and other cool mods like that, but it doesn't capture how you should end up.  
I mean, you should end up a god, but that's not fun.  
You'll get bored within a couple of minutes.

Another that has annoyed me, is that people argue that having something really overpowered just brings all these problems.  
Maybe.  
But you're forgetting one thing, the reason minecraft is fun, and moderately easy, at the start, is because everything is level for that.  
But once you get to the realm of the gods, it gets easy.

What if, we level stuff at the power of gods.  
What if, we gave everyone, the power of gods.  
What if, god became the common man.
