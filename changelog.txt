Changelog:
Build 0.0.015
    Added support for a HUD blacklist.
    - A render blacklist: Whether it should render the item in the HUD.
    - A scanner blacklist: Whether the block should be scanned, and displayed.
    - An ignore whitelist: If the block is added to this, the inventory will be rendered regardless, useful for things that are not full blocks, or something like the Inventory scanner.
    Fixed a couple of bugs.
    Added support itemStacks in the packets equals method.
    Added support for vertical rotation, to enable it, change it in the config.
    Cleaned rendering code, should be much more efficient.
    Made some debugging easier.
    Fixed a derp with the HUD with custom tileEntities and tileEntities that extend ISidedInventory.
    Made the texture for the hover boots really sexy.
    Re-added recipes because why the hell not.
    Fixed hovering on a server. Still more to be done, but basic functionality is there.
    Changed the texture for hovering, because this one looks cooler.
    Added the Atomic Constructor. It will serve as the machine in the future whenever you want to build something.
    Added the drone. It's for the atomic constructor. These are the things that will build your item.
    Changed the model for the inventory scanner, and texture, because it was ugly beyond belief, now it's slightly more tolerable.
    Changed a fair amount of textures.
    Cleaned a chunk of rendering code for both the HUD and for some tile Renderers.
    The Atomic constructor is now a completely dynamic multiblock. Placing multiple next to each other will increase the range the drones can travel in.
    Added the solar lens. Used to power the atomic constructor. Must be in sight of the sky, and at least 2 blocks above the constructor. It doesn't have to be directly above it, it will loop down, until it hits the ground, and then spread within a 5x5 centred around the block it hit looking for them. They can power as many as 25. As hitting one doesn't mean that it stops looking.
    Added the CoFHLib, because it made a lot of things a lot easier.
    The code for the HUD renderer now supports damage values.
    
Build 0.0.014
    Added fancy model for the Inventory Scanner.
    Fixed more rendering.
    Cleaned up more random code.
    Removed CCL, as never really used it.
    Cleaned a large amount of HUD code, seem to be doing that a lot. Mainly because I forget what I do, and I have to write something, or it just seems I spend forever doing nothing.
    Starting to clean the Inventory Scanner code, as it's a complete mess.
    Recipes were removed, because lots of items, and not enough 1.6.
    Fixed some of the glasses packet code. Tad more effective.
    Cleaned up Inventory Scanner renderer code. Looks prettier.
    Made some framework cooler, such as item information.
    Fixed hover boots a ton. Work a lot more like "hover" boots.
    Implemented a blacklist for glasses.
    Hover boots circle thing now fades as time runs out.
    Added a whole new layer of debugging code, should make things easier.
    Fixed packet removing. Inventory scanner now behaves as it should.

    Fixed more rendering, so it WILL be better.
    Flipped the HUD Renderer, so now they render similar to proper items in inventories.
    Started work for the Inventory Scanner model, will be very minimal.
    Fixed the gravity pulling you down with the hover boots.
    Added a recipe for the glasses for people who want to play with them in survival.

    Added config option for inventory slot texturing for the glasses.
    Added config option for idle packet timing for glasses, leave this if you don't know what it does.

    Added hover boots, makes you.. hover..
    Added Inventory scanner, eventually a block that will give you the inventory without the glasses, incase you want to wear something else.
