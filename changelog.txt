Changelog:
Build 0.0.015
    Added support for a HUD blacklist.
    - A render blacklist: Whether it should render the item in the HUD.
    - A scanner blacklist: Whether the block should be scanned, and displayed.
    - An ignore whitelist: If the block is added to this, the inventory will be rendered regardless, useful for things that are not full blocks, or something like the Inventory scanner.

    Added support itemStacks in the packets equals method.
    Added support for vertical rotation, to enable it, change it in the config.
